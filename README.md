A puzzle game where you roll around a die.

This game was made for the GMTK 2022 GameJam, a 48-hour game development marathon where the games were based on the theme “Roll of the Dice”. I’ve made the source code and the assets of my game open source, not just because knowledge sharing is vital, but because I have learned a lot from looking at the code of other open source projects (thank you!) and I want to give back.
 
**Play the game here:**

Use the arrow keys to move in a direction a number of spaces equal your face-up number. Press Space while on a rotator platform to rotate the dice. All Hard levels are unlocked once you complete all the beginner levels.

### Of interest to other game developers:

Something that other game developers might be interested in, which gave me a bit of trouble, was being able to find what number of the dice was facing upwards so that it rolls a number of times equal to that. You can find this code here:

Another feature of the game is the preview dice, which the player can use to plan their move ahead of time by being able to see all sides of the dice at any time and also being able to see what side the dice is going to land on after a certain amount of rotations.
